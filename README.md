*IRG repository for multivariate meta-analyses, including standard NMAs and cNMAs

A standard pairwise meta-analysis can compare the efficacy of two interventions/treatments that have been directly compared in studies. However, there are often many potential interventions for a single outcome. Policy-makers and educators need to be able to select the best intervention, best intervention component, or best bundle of intervention components from amongst the many potential options. Network meta-analysis is an extension of standard pairwise meta-analysis that can be used to simultaneously compare any number of interventions or intervention components.
